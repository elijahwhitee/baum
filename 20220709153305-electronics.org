*** Design process
1. Create symbol     ----> library editor
2. Schematic capture ----> eschema
3. Create footprints ----> footprint editor
4. Generate netlist  ----> cvpcb
5. Board Layout      ----> pcbnew
6. Prodction         ----> Gerbview
7. Generate BOM      ----> Digi-key

*** Mechanical keyboard
My ortholinear perfectly designed keyboard,
**** Design
***** Eclipse design
The keyboard will be ortholinear and splitable, and be only 60% of size.
it will have a small trackball representing the sun, an esc key representing the earth and smaller knob at thumb distance representing  the moon.
Colors will be black and white. Each major part of the keyboard being the opposite
***** Trackball design
Pomoroni trackball.
