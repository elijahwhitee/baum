To be enlightened is to be aware, always, of total reality in its immanent otherness - to be aware of it and yet to remain in a condition to survive as an animal, to think and feel as a human being, to resort whenever expedient to systematic reasoning. Our goal is to discover that we have always been where we ought to be. Unhappily we make the task exceedingly difficult for ourselves. Meanwhile, however, there are gratuitous graces in the form of partial and fleeting realizations. Under a more realistic, a less exclusively verbal system of education than ours, every Angel (in Blake's sense of that word) would be permitted as a sabbatical treat, would be urged and even, if necessary, compelled to take an occasional trip through some chemical Door in the Wall into the world of transcendental experience. If it terrified him, it would be unfortunate but probably salutary. If it brought him a brief but timeless illumination, so much the better. In either case the Angel might lose a little of the confident insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning and the consciousness of having read all the books

Programmers are able not only to play around with JBoss AS but also to have a view into the JBoss AS project’s transparent development process. They can view the bugtracking database, read about designs for upcoming features, and look through the developer forums to see what the lead developers of the different product modules are discussing. They can also look through the code to understand it, to debug issues, or to learn how JBoss AS works. Best of all, they can contribute to the process on several different levels. They can report, comment on, and discuss issues with the developers who are working on them. If there’s a bug in a feature of JBoss AS that they’re using, they can patch it and submit it for acceptance into a future release. Or, if they’re particularly devoted, they can become regular contributors and take on programming tasks

JBoss AS and all of its configuration files are contained entirely under a single directory structure. If you want to uninstall JBoss AS, you delete the entire directory structure. If you want to move the installation somewhere else, you move the entire directory structure. After you have a customized configuration on one machine, it’s best to duplicate the existing configuration on other development or production machines rather than trying to manually re-create the configuration or trying to rerun the installer.

we’ll discuss in section 1.3.8, one of the best things to do is to version-control the entire server structure (or at least the configuration directory). If you choose to use the installer, our recommendation is to use it to install JBoss AS on a single machine, customize the server’s configuration, version-control the configuration, and then check out the latest configuration on other machines. This helps you ensure that your server configuration is exactly the same across installations

JBoss runs on top of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but some things are done better with native operating system functionality. For example, web pages can generally be served with better performance when using native libraries. Running an application as an operating-system service is also more easily accomplished with native support. For these things, JBoss provides a supplementary library called JBoss Native that can be downloaded and unzipped into your application server’s bin directory. You can download JBoss Native from http://labs.jboss.com/jbossweb/downloads

This is because the client libraries are generally for remote access to a server. In many web applications, the web-tier code and the EJB code are often collocated in the same server and share the same set of server libraries. Web browsers can communicate with the web tier over HTTP and don’t need any of the client libraries packaged with JBoss AS. The web tier can then communicate with the EJB server making local calls because they’re both running in the same JVM instance

When you copy an application into the server as an exploded directory structure, it’s possible for the deployment descriptor to get copied before all the application resources are copied. This can be bad because JBoss AS triggers deployments based on detection of or updates to the deployment descriptor; so, the server may try to deploy an incomplete application. On some OSs, you can avoid this by doing a move rather than a copy because a move is treated as an atomic operation. That means that none of the files is made available until all of them are available. If the server does try to deploy a partially-copied application, then you can redeploy it by updating the appropriate deployment descriptor as we discuss in chapter 3

This new microcontainer architecture has several benefits over the old JMX kernel architecture.First, it’s much lighter because it doesn’t have to support JMX, allowing you to build even smaller minimal configurations.Second, services built on top of the microcontainer can be deployed standalone, within another application server such as BEA’s WebLogic Server, or even within a web server such as Tomcat. For example, the EJB3 container could be deployed on the Tomcat web server because the EJB3 container is based on the microcontainer.

While formulas such as the classic “net working capital” test are necessary to support an investment analysis, value investing is not a paintby-numbers exercise. 6 Skepticism and judgment are always required. For one thing, not all elements affecting value are captured in a company’s financial statements—inventories can grow obsolete and receivables uncollectible; liabilities are sometimes unrecorded and property values over- or understated.Second, valuation is an art, not a science

Another reason that greater competition may not hinder today’s value investors is the broader and more diverse investment landscape in which they operate. Graham faced a limited lineup of publicly traded U.S. equity and debt securities.Today, there are many thousands of publicly traded stocks in the United States alone, and many tens of thousands worldwide, plus thousands of corporate bonds and asset-backed debt securities. Previously illiquid assets, such as bank loans, now trade regularly. Investors may also choose from an almost limitless number of derivative instruments, including customized contracts designed to meet any need or hunch

For example, the debt of Enron, perhaps the world’s most stigmatized company after an accounting scandal forced it into bankruptcy in 2001, traded as low as 10 cents on the dollar of claim; ultimate recoveries are expected to be six times that amount.Similarly, companies with tobacco or asbestos exposure have in recent years periodically come under severe selling pressure due to the uncertainties surrounding litigation and the resultant risk of corporate financial distress. More generally, companies that disappoint or surprise investors with lower-than-expected results, sudden management changes, accounting problems, or ratings downgrades are more likely than consistently strong performers to be sources of opportunity.

Similarly, the pair never addressed how to analyze the purchase of an office building or apartment complex. Real estate bargains come about for the same reasons as securities bargains—an urgent need for cash, inability to perform proper analysis, a bearish macro view, or investor disfavor or neglect. In a bad real estate climate, tighter lending standards can cause even healthy properties to sell at distressed prices. Graham and Dodd’s principles—such as the stability of cash flow, sufficiency of return, and analysis of downside risk—allow us to identify real estate investments with a margin of safety in any market environment

Instead, institutional investing has evolved into a short-term performance derby, which makes it difficult for institutional managers to take contrarian or long-term positions.Indeed, rather than standing apart from the crowd and possibly suffering disappointing short-term results that could cause clients to withdraw capital, institutional investors often prefer the safe haven of assured mediocre performance that can be achieved only by closely following the herd.

Oddly enough, despite 75 years of success achieved by value investors, one group of observers largely ignores or dismisses this discipline: academics. Academics tend to create elegant theories that purport to explain the real world but in fact oversimplify it. One such theory, the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), holds that security prices always and immediately reflect all available information, an idea deeply at odds with Graham and Dodd’s notion that there is great value to fundamental security analysis. The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates risk to return but always mistakes volatility, or beta, for risk. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) applauds the benefits of diversification in constructing an

The hysterical tenor is exacerbated at every turn. For example, CNBC frequently uses a formatted screen that constantly updates the level of the major market indexes against a digital clock. Not only is the time displayed in hours, minutes, and seconds but in completely useless hundredths of seconds, the numbers flashing by so rapidly (like tenths of a cent on the gas pump) as to be completely unreadable

HTTP is a simple protocol—it’s based on text headers. A client sends a request to a server, and the server sends a response back to the browser with the requested document attached. The server is dumb4—it doesn’t remember anything about the client if another document is requested. This lack of memory means that HTTP is a “stateless” protocol; it maintains no information about the client between requests

One of the best features of twiddle is that it’s open source. Because the source is accessible, you can use it as an example of how to programmatically access MBeans. The main class can be found in the source distribution at console/src/main/org/ jboss/console/twiddle/Twiddle.java, and a class for each command can be found in the console/src/main/org/jboss/console/twiddle/command directory. These classes illustrate how you can write your own programs to manipulate JMX MBeans. Of particular interest is the method Twiddle.createMBeanServerConnection, which shows how to access the MBean server, and the execute method in each of the command classes, such as GetCommand, which illustrates how to manipulate MBeans

three.jar is in the server/xxx/lib directory and contains version 1 of class C, whereas EAR files one.ear and two.ear are in the server/xxx/deploy directory, and contain classes A and B, respectively. In addition, two.ear contains version 2 of class C. To ensure that the classes in two.ear pick up the correct version of class C, a loader repository is declared within two.ear. When class A references class C, it gets the one in three.jar, but when class B references class C, it gets the one in two.ear. Using EAR files is an example; we could have used SAR, JAR

XA is an API defined by The Open Group’s Distributed Transaction Processing model. This model provides communications mechanisms between a Transaction Monitor and several resource managers, which perform updates against databases. The Transaction Monitor is responsible for coordinating the individual transactions handled by the resource managers to ensure transactional semantics when multiple resource managers are involved in a single transaction

Even when the underlying motive of purchase is mere speculative greed, human nature desires to conceal this unlovely impulse behind a screen of apparent logic and good sense. To adapt the aphorism of Voltaire, it may be said that if there were no such thing as common-stock analysis, it would be necessary to counterfeit it

Edgar Lawrence Smith, however, did receive Bosland’s full and respectful attention. Smith’s Common Stocks as Long Term Investments, published in 1924, had challenged the long-held view that bonds were innately superior to equities. For one thing, Smith argued, the dollar (even the gold-backed 1924 edition) was infation-prone, which meant that creditors were inherently disadvantaged. Not so the owners of common stock. If the companies in which they invested earned a proft, and if the managements of those companies retained a portion of that proft in the business, and if those retained earnings, in turn, produced future earnings, the principal value of an investor’s portfolio would tend “to increase in accordance with the operation of compound interest.”22

These types of methods are called action methods. The goodbye method is associated with the Goodbye HtmlCommandButton on hello.jsp via its action property. So when a user clicks the Goodbye button, the goodbye method is executed. In this case, goodbye doesn’t do any work to determine the logical outcome; it just returns "success". This outcome is associated with a specific page in a Faces configuration file, which we cover next. Because goodbye doesn’t perform any processing (as it would in a real application), we could have achieved the same effect by hardcoding the text "success" in the button’s action property. This is because the navigation system will either use the literal value of an HtmlCommandButton’s action property or the outcome of an action method (if the property references one
