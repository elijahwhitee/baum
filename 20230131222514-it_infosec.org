"Memory forensics is arguably the most fruitful, interesting, and provocative realm of digital forensics. Each function performed by an operating system or applica- tion results in specific modifications to the computerâ€™s memory (RAM), which can often persist a long time after the action, essentially preserving them. Additionally, memory forensics provides unprecedented visibility into the runtime state of the system, such as which processes were running, open network connections, and recently executed com- mands. You can extract these artifacts in a manner that is completely independent of the system you are investigating, reducing the chance that malware or rootkits can interfere with your results. Critical data often exists exclusively in memory, such as disk encryp- tion keys, memory-resident injected code fragments, off-the-record chat messages, unen-crypted eâ€‘mail messages, and non-cacheable Internet history records."
