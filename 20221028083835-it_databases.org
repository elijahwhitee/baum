* Databases
** Mongodb
No sql database based on BSON documents
to store data, it can work in clusters
of processes to keep redundancy and
maintability.
*** Replica sets
Mongodb's replica sets is a mechanic
in which multiple running replicas
can work in conjunction to keep
redundancy, they can act on failure of the *primary node*
**** Primary node
The only node in the cluster que accepts write operations, the rest
of the nodes keep track of the information stored in the primary node.
*** Schema
**** Computed pattern
**** Bucket pattern
**** Document pattern
**** Embeeded vs linked
*** Commands
**** Tricks
